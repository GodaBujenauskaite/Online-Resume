    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
       <li><h2>Video games</h2></li> 
            <p>Playing video games really improved my critical thinking. 
                Planning perfect paths, solving puzzles improves critical 
                thinking that can be used in real life or work problems. 
                It also improves concentration, memory, hand-eye coordination, 
                strategic thinking and time management skills. It also helps with 
                becoming hardworking and not giving up so easily.</p>

       <li><h2>Singing and playing the piano</h2></li> 
            <p>I have been playing the piano and singing since I was five. 
                I have finished music school of 7 years and stayed there 
                for extra 4 more years after graduating. It improved my social skills, 
                my creativity and attention to details. It improved concentration and 
                my maht skills, since music relies heavily on rythm. In addition 
                I became very good at multi-tasking and I improved my cultural 
                knowledge regarding the art area.</p>

        <li><h2>Cooking</h2></li> 
        <p>Cooking has taught me to always try new things and to not be scared
             to make mistakes. It also teaches to not give up and that you 
             can achieve anything with just a bit of practise. It improves 
             organization and planning skills and relieves stress.</p>

       <li><h2>Arts and crafts</h2></li> 
       <p>In my spare time I also love to take up art projects, 
            including knitting, sowing, crocheting, painting, sclupting, 
            writing songs or articles. It gave me tons of ideas for inspiration, 
            improved my memory and attention to detail. It also improves my motor 
            skills and has a lot of emotional benefits. In addition, it improves 
            my patience, since projects take up a long time to finish.</p>
